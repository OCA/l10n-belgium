* The current version of the Belgian Intrastat reporting module is only based on invoices.
  Since associated stock moves are not taken into consideration, it is possible that manual
  corrections are required, e.g.
  Product movements without invoices are not included in the current version
  of this module and must be added manually to the report lines
  before generating the ONEGATE XML declaration.

* Refunds on invoices within the same reporting period are deducted from the declaration lines.
  No controls are executed on Refunds that are not linked to an invoice
  in the same reporting period.
  Such Refunds are reported under the default transaction code for refunds.
  It is recommend to manually set the correct transaction code while Credit Notes
  are created.

* The current version of the Belgian Intrastat reporting module does not perform a
  cross-check with the VAT declaration.
