  The configuration data is loaded when installing the module.
  We do not recommend to change these settings.

  A configuration wizard (part of the **intrastat_product** module) also allows to update the
  Intrastat Codes so that you can easily synchronise your Odoo instance with the latest list
  of codes supplied by the configuration wizard.
  (an update is published on an annual basis by the Belgian National Bank).

|

* Product

  You can define a default Intrastat Code on the Product or the Product Category.

|

* Fiscal Positions

  Check your Fiscal Positions and set the 'Intrastat' field for transactions that must be included
  in the intrastat declaration.
  We recommend to set the 'VAT required' flag on the 'Intra Community Regime' Fiscal Position
  for B2B customers.

  If you have B2C customers or B2B customers which are not subject to VAT you can create a
  'Intra Community Regime NA' Fiscal Position on which the 'Intrastat' field is set to B2C
  while the 'VAT required' flag has been turned off.

|

* Partner

  Ensure that your B2B Customer records have a valid VAT Number.

  Consider the use of the OCA **account_fiscal_position_vat_check module** to enforce the correct setting.
